      Re: Application for Continuing Care Assistant (CCA) – NOC 33102
    </p>

    <p>Dear Hiring Manager,</p>

    <p>
      I am applying for a Continuing Care Assistant position and would welcome the opportunity to contribute to your
      care team. I bring over 3.5 years of hands-on experience in municipal long-term eldercare in Sweden, along with a
      strong commitment to person-centered, compassionate care. I am fully prepared to relocate and work anywhere within
      Saskatchewan.
    </p>

    <p>
      I currently work at Kallebäcks Boende in Gothenburg, where I provide daily care for residents with dementia and
      complex physical needs. My responsibilities include assisting with Activities of Daily Living (ADLs), safe patient
      handling, monitoring vital signs, supporting medication routines, and maintaining accurate digital documentation
      in electronic health record (EHR) systems. I work closely with nurses and multidisciplinary teams to ensure
      continuity and quality of care.
    </p>

    <p>
      In addition, I hold a Ph.D. in Psychology, which strengthens my ability to support residents with cognitive,
      emotional, and behavioral challenges. This background allows me to manage responsive behaviors using
      trauma-informed care, empathy, and de-escalation techniques. My professional focus and long-term commitment are
      firmly rooted in front-line caregiving.
    </p>

    <p>
      I am seeking a long-term, full-time position and am available for day, evening, night, weekend, and holiday
      shifts. I have researched Saskatchewan’s long-term care requirements and am committed to completing all required
      Continuing Care Assistant certification components immediately upon arrival.
    </p>

    <p>
      Certifications (planned upon arrival): Transfer, Lifting, and Repositioning (TLR); Professional Assault Response
      Training (PART).
    </p>

    <p>
      Thank you for considering my application. I would welcome the opportunity to discuss how my international
      experience, strong work ethic, and dedication to high-quality care can support your residents and care team.
    </p>
